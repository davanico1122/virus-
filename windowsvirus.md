## Safety Protocols

**Critical Warning**: This module includes destructive features for research purposes only:

1. **Isolation Requirements**:
   - Run in dedicated Windows VM
   - Disable network adapters
   - Use virtual drives for USB simulation
   - Isolate from host systems

2. **Safety Measures**:
   - Automatic VM snapshots before execution
   - Network isolation controls
   - Time-limited execution
   - Hardware resource limits

3. **Ethical Guidelines**:
   - Never test on production systems
   - Obtain proper authorization
   - Follow institutional review processes
   - Document all research activities

## Building and Execution

### Build Requirements
- Go 1.20+
- Windows 10/11 SDK
