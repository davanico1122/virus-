# HELLO RANSOMWARE RESEARCH EDITION - README

## Overview

The **Hello Ransom Research Edition** is an advanced ransomware *simulator* designed for security research and defensive testing. It is intended to operate **without admin privileges** and includes safety features for VM testing environments.

> **Important:** This project is for research and education only. Do **not** deploy on production or unauthorized systems.

---

## Key Features

### Safe Operation Mode

* **VM Detection:** Automatically detects virtual machines and adjusts behavior.
* **Non-Destructive:** No MBR overwrite or system file corruption.
* **Research Focus:** Clearly labeled as a research tool in all outputs and artefacts.
* **Safe File Sizes:** Limits encryption to files â‰¤ **50 MB**.

### Advanced Encryption

**Hybrid Cryptosystem:**

* **AES-256-GCM** for symmetric file encryption.
* **RSA-4096** for encrypting symmetric keys.
* **PBKDF2** for key derivation (300,000 iterations).
* **File Selection:** Targets user documents only (document formats and user profile dirs).
* **Parallel Processing:** 32-thread encryption engine for simulation speed.

### Persistence Mechanisms (Non-Admin)

* **Registry (HKCU):** `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
* **Startup Folder:** `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
* **AppData Copy:** Executable copied to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\helloransom.exe`

### Evasion Techniques (Simulated)

* Anti-debugging checks (non-destructive)
* Randomized filenames for simulated operations
* Memory-only operations where possible
* **No network callbacks** by default (configurable)
* VM-aware operational adjustments

### User Interaction

* Desktop wallpaper modification (configurable / non-destructive)
* Multiple ransom notes dropped in user directories
* Interactive popup notifications with research labeling

## Safety Features

```go
const SAFE_MODE = true // Enable all safety features

// Safety implementations:
// 1. No system modification
// 2. VM detection skips destructive operations
// 3. Limited file size encryption
// 4. Research warnings in all messages
// 5. No privilege escalation attempts
```

## Testing Protocol

### Recommended Environment

* **Virtualization:** VMware Workstation 17+ or VirtualBox 7.0+
* **OS:** Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
* **Tools:**

  * Wireshark (network analysis)
  * Process Monitor (behavior analysis)
  * REMnux (malware analysis toolkit)

### Test Procedure

1. **Build executable:**

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o hello_research.exe
```

2. **Execute in VM:**

```powershell
Start-Process .\hello_research.exe
```

3. **Monitor effects:**

* Check user document encryption
* Verify persistence entries
* Note visual effects and popups
* Revert VM snapshot for repeated testing

---

## Expected Behavior

* Copies itself to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\`
* Creates persistence entries (HKCU Run, Startup LNK)
* Encrypts user documents with `.HELLORANSOM` extension
* Displays ransom notes on Desktop and Documents folders
* Shows **3 popup notifications** during run
* Changes desktop wallpaper (disabled in SAFE\_MODE on non-VMs)

---

## Recovery Procedure

1. **Remove persistence:**

```reg
reg delete HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v HelloRansomResearch /f
```

2. **Delete files:**

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\helloransom.exe"
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\HelloRansom.lnk"
```

3. Restore files using the included decryption tool (follow the decryption tool instructions).

## Ethical Guidelines

* **Legal Compliance:** Use only in controlled, authorized environments.
* **Authorization:** Never deploy without explicit written permission.
* **Disclosure:** Clearly label all outputs as a research tool.
* **Containment:** Isolate test environments from production networks.
* **Responsibility:** Researchers accept full responsibility for usage.

---

## Research Applications

* Defense strategy development
* Detection engineering
* Incident response training
* Behavioral analysis
* Honeypot enhancement

## Q\&A

**Q: How does it avoid VM detection?**
A: When `SAFE_MODE=true`, destructive operations are skipped but core simulation functionality still runs.

**Q: Can this infect real systems?**
A: It is designed for research and can modify user files; **always** use within VM snapshots.

**Q: How to get decryption tool?**
A: Contact `nskj546@gmail.com` with a research proposal.

**Q: What if it escapes the VM?**
A: The tool includes network isolation checks and will refuse to execute destructive flows when SAFE\_MODE is enabled.
